## My process
I used divs for grouping element, giving them class names helped me style them with css properties.
With the use of index and position absolute/relative properties on svg's and images I positioned images and svg's in precise areas of the webpage.
### Built with

***********HTML************

### What I learned

Developing this project has helped me improve on my css skills. Using css positions, multiple media queries for respective screen views, indexing of images


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
Desktop
#indexed-img1{
    z-index: 1;
    position: absolute;
    left: 10rem;
    top: 23.5rem;
}

Tablet
@media screen and (max-width: 768px){

  }
  .div{
    display: flex
    flex-direction: row;
  }
}

Mobile
@media screen and (max-width: 600px){
    .#indexed-svg1{
        left: 8rem;
    }
}

### Continued development

my font family use, font sizing, box shadowing, and more Importantly my text wraping, responsive container needs more practice and imrovement.
